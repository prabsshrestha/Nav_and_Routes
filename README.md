# Nav_and_Routes
# Master branch contains the code 
# Simple Flutter project with easy-to-use routing and navigation features 

**Using Named Routes:
Named routes allow you to define and navigate to routes using a specific identifier (route name) rather than pushing a new route with a widget. This method is useful for more structured and maintainable navigation. You define named routes in the MaterialApp widget using the routes parameter.**
